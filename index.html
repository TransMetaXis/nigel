        <h1>What Is Exalted Nature?</h1>
        <p>This site has been about ten years in the making from the first poem in the first book to the last build of the third game. Only recently did I give enough consideration in building this creative expression hub partly because I've always had a hard time with the game portion in general thinking the graphic art quality isn't very professional thereby having little to no desire to release it to the public. I overcame those hesitations simply because of the wise, time-honored phrase of 'why not?'.</p>
        <p>Back in the year 2014, I was very drawn to the the act of taking advantage of my gradually decreasing hypo-manic state from a previous loss of touch with reality by expressing myself through the art of poetry. There were moments where I believed my creative flow and connection to source would be inevitably severed once my highly stimulated mind came back down completely and normalized. But the connections remained even after I fully recovered.</p>
        <p>I didn't think much about it at the time while writing my first batch of poems I was just enjoying the process living in the moment. Little did I know I had eventually garnered enough works to fill my first book Destined Crest and from then on I remained inspired to continue and complete the poetry trilogy. With Destined Crest's cover art being a piece by my late aunt Charlyn, Adorned Road's cover drawn by Mac Peters who also helped with this website, and the third cover for Bloomed Scope being a piece by yours truly.</p>
        <p>What got me on the path of eventually writing and developing the Exalted Nature visual novel trilogy was during school when given a text adventure assignment that I was to program in DOS. I came up with the story of Elzarus a sort of homage to the biblical figure Lazarus. He would go on a journey of self discovery of his potential while trying to save his planet. Not an exact homage to Lazarus but there is a distinct similarity in one part of his life.</p>
        <p>I'd like to say that besides the trials I've had to go through and I've had my fair share, and besides all the negativity that is prevalent on the planet at this stage of our evolution, I make a point to feel gratitude for how lucky I've been in my life. Lucky to be alive for one, lucky to have my loved ones near and dear to me who I love with all my heart, and lucky to have the freedom to not only have access to assistance from those who wish the best for me, to be able to give assistance to those who I can help, but the freedom to find a sort of peace of mind, a sort of zen, an aspiration for an enlightened mind.</p>
