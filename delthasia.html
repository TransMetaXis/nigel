        <h1>What Is Delthasia?</h1>
          <p>This is the first of the three visual novels of the Exalted Nature game series. Heavy on story, light on gameplay and medium on humor. The gameplay consists of linear exploration with a turn-based combat system. Some encounters will be avoidable, others not. Also there are points in which you must interact with the play screen to for instance open doors or activate objects. There is also a dialogue and morality choice system that appears in certain scenes</p>
          <p>The story itself revolves around the unlikely hero Elzarus. A member of a sect of druidic healers meant to cleanse the land of darkness, injury or disease as well as being able to bring abundance and growth to the nature of the land of Delthasia. He is tasked by the gods and goddesses of the planet to travel the continent in search of the root cause of what is currently ailing Delthasia and bring her back to peace.</p>
          <p>These three games were intended to be experienced first with Delthasia, then Vuldron and finally Aerde even though Vuldron is a prequel to Delthasia. The reason I suggest Vuldron is played before Delthasia (in chronological order) is due to elements of Vuldron's story tying into parts of the foundation of Aerde's story therefore the elements of the ending of Delthasia wouldn't easily lead into the beginning of Aerde as much but I suppose if you wanna give it a shot I won't stop you. I hope you enjoy the journey of this trilogy, five years in the making.</p>
          <p>Certain scenes will have Elzarus as a movable player on the screen usually travelling to the next chapter of the story. Simply click or touch on the screen where you'd like him to go which will usually be to the right to progress, or you may choose to collide Elzarus with an enemy to engage in combat. Otherwise the green arrow will progress the story and the multiple dialogue choices and morality will activate with a click on the desired choice.</p>
          <p>Unlike the other two games where you can save at any point, there would've needed to be a major overhaul of Delthasia to implement that system so instead, saving is automatic at certain intervals of the game as in after chapters or major events. This will be indicated to you by a black and white autosave notification in the upper left corner of the game screen.</p>
