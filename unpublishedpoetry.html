        <h1>What Is My Unpublished Poetry?</h1>
        <p>The following works are some of my creative expressions during the years of approximately 2020-2022. Many of them are inspirational and shows my intent for a higher more aligned level for our species and planet. Yet some of them have to do with the Covid-19 disease, the vaccination agenda, the lockdowns and our response to it both by the governments of the world and the response from the people as well. I voice my frustrations in great detail all in poetry form and near the tail end of that burst of creative inspiration I write about the trucker protest as well. These poems were my main method of getting my message across but it wasn't all doom and gloom. Through times of darkness, a light can always be found that one may focus on for hope, love, peace and joy to arrive.</p>
        <p><strong>Notable</strong><br>When all seems lost in this day and age<br>When we don't like the looks of this freshly turned page<br>When the world feels as though we're sinking down<br>When we sense something really wrong in cities and towns
        <p>It lets me learn a quote by the late Bob Marley<br>One love, One heart, One destiny<br>I think about this quote like the three are connected<br>And when I look at anyone I see myself reflected</p>
        <p>It gives me one from the late Mark Twain<br>Wrinkles should merely indicate where the smiles have been<br>That makes me think of time and how laugh lines are made<br>And memories of happiness that never have to fade</p>
        <p>I discover a quote from the late Bertrand Russell<br>To be happy you first accept that the world is horrible<br>This one speaks to all of us right now it's very poignant<br>That doesn't mean our lives must go without enjoyment</p>
        <p>This teaches me of one from the late Joseph Campbell<br>Following bliss, doors open where there were only walls<br>This is advice I'm sure a lot of us need<br>To see where the new worlds and vistas will lead</p>
        <p>I try in my own way to honor these heroes<br>To share what their wisdom reveals and shows<br>Maybe to live it not write it is a better way to go<br>Would honor them more and the words they bestow</p>
        <p><strong>64</strong><br>I hold my tongue<br>Until we've won<br>Til then I must<br>Hold fast and trust</p>
        <p>In mankind's good<br>As well I should<br>With spirit strong<br>We reach beyond</p>
        <p>Since in this tale<br>We shall not fail<br>We will not bail<br>We won't derail</p>
        <p>I hear the sound<br>From out of bounds<br>It's getting near<br>Nothing to fear</p>
        <p><strong>Public Safety</strong><br>With all of us social distancing and ordered to wear masks<br>Something's been on my mind so I really have to ask<br>If I got the common cold with fever, sniffles and the rest<br>Would I test positive for a covid-19 test?<br>You don't hear much about the common cold these days<br>Lately everyone who's sick has covid so they say<br>Does it not make you wonder where the cold and flu have gone?<br>And if you bring that up you're told obey because you're wrong<br>Whenever I acquiesce to rules of constriction<br>I feel like I dishonor all the truth of my convictions<br>Remember that I've touched only on one point of this scam<br>There's also death rates vaccines hospitals the list goes on god damn<br>Perhaps you don't appreciate this poem not one bit<br>Well I try to help the veil to lift but if not so be it</p>
        <p><strong>Scales to Tip</strong><br>I got a funny feeling this will all work out<br>A feeling that the human race will find another route<br>Because if I continue feeling pangs of nagging doubt<br>I'll give in to ignoring what this life is all about</p>
        <p>There's so much beauty I can find in this world of ours<br>Many people lifting consciousness in order to empower<br>Even though authority will loom above us like dark towers<br>They regardless have the time to be at peace or smell the flowers</p>
        <p>I think of myself at times to walk the line of good and bad<br>Based on how I hope and dream or based on failures I have had<br>This type of balance that I give myself will tend to make me sad<br>Feeling I have so much work to do so much more good to add</p>
        <p>But enough of that I think I'll think about more pleasant stuff<br>Cause I know that lately my mindset has been a little rough<br>Just don't test me on how good I feel you might just call my bluff<br>Okay I feel as though my mood has elevated just enough</p>
        <p>If you made it this far thank you cause your eyes they mean a lot<br>Let us take a deep breath and let go of all these fights weve fought<br>Concentrate on all the love within your life and all it's brought<br>That could bring us closer to a world like that or so I've thought</p>
        <p><strong>Pro-Choice</strong><br>I had mentioned a terminal case<br>In my previous vaccine poem<br>Of a mother who's life was erased<br>Leaving her kids to grow up alone</p>
        <p>I mention it now first because<br>You might not roll back to the reference<br>Well she died from the vaccine which was<br>Pressured to her not her preference</p>
        <p>The vaccine is safe for the public<br>Tell that to the lives that are lost<br>Vaccine deaths right now are the subject<br>Let's do our social duty but at what cost</p>
        <p>You can tell me all you want<br>About there being a small chance<br>That one will die from the death shot<br>In spite of that I hold my stance</p>
        <p>That fact that one needs to concede<br>That there's a chance that one could die<br>Makes any defense of the vaccine<br>Absolutely nullified</p>
        <p>I said that I was gonna be mature<br>And not get emotionally charged<br>But my vaccine view is secure<br>Any science logic I will fully disregard</p>
        <p>Because We All Know That It's True<br>That You Can Die From The Vaccines<br>Think I'm scared of covid I'm 42<br>And have no co-morbidities</p>
        <p>And don't you tell me I endanger<br>When I know I'm in good health<br>Cause a fully vaxxed stranger<br>Wouldn't even know he's spreading it himself</p>
        <p>And say I end up asymptomatic<br>well then I guess that's same as being vaxxed<br>Except I didn't need to risk traumatic<br>Death and that's a fact</p>
        <p>What's with all the hyperbole<br>All it is is a pin prick<br>This is my right to choose personally<br>THIS FUCKING PRESSURE MAKES ME SICK</p>
