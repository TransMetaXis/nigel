        <h1>What Is Aerde?</h1>
          <p>This is the third and final entry in the Exalted Nature visual novel trilogy and it has been my largest undertaking in terms of game development which includes my experience in story telling as well.</p>
          <p>It took me a little more than two years on and off and you could probably tell by the fact that it contains over 80 different characters with speaking roles minor and major, spans multiple planets as well as dimensions, and the total length of the story in terms of time lasts over 20 years.</p>
          <p>There is significantly less humor in this story as well as less player freedom but that had to be the case for what I wanted to achieve. It is more linear storywise but the counterpart to that is the ability for the player to choose in which order they play most of the chapters in specific sets.</p>
          <p>If you've made it this far through the other two stories I sincerely commend you since I'm sure there have been times where you got tired of clicking the next button over and over but if you're reading this and haven't started Aerde yet, this piece of creative expression means a lot to me and it means the world to me that you'd take the time.</p>
          <p>Arguably the easiest controls of the three games, there are minor interactions with the environment and major interactions with the next button. The other controls would be during the chapter selection, clicking the desired chapter when you're ready to continue. Save anytime you want and don't forget to save before ending your session. Your save slot will be created on your first save and each save after that will overwrite the save for that playthrough.</p>
